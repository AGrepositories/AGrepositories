### Hi there 👋
### This is the GitHub profile for our research group, The Aikens Research Laboratory 🧪👩🏻‍🔬👨🏻‍🔬🖥️

📁 Here you'll be able to find some useful scripts that can accelerate your research process!

💻 Given the wide range of software programs that our group uses, there are a number of approaches to analyze the result that they provide. Not only analyzing, trying to perform recurring calculations more efficiently can be sometimes challenging.

🖥️ As a result, the scripts that are provided here can be adapted for a single task or even multiple tasks 😄!

⚛️ So go ahead and use them for your work!

### Extending the repository

⚗️ This is not the end! Feel free to modify these existing scripts, depending on your usage of the script or even to improve them.

💡 Please feel free to create a new repository if you have any other scripts that our group could find useful.
