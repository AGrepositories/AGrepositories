### Hi there 👋
### This is the GitHub profile for our research group, The Aikens Research Laboratory 🧪👩🏻‍🔬👨🏻‍🔬🖥️

📁 Here you'll be able to find some useful scripts that can accelerate your research process!

💻 Given the wide range of software programs that our group uses, there are a number of approaches to analyze the result that they provide. Not only analyzing, trying to perform recurring calculations more efficiently can be sometimes challenging.

🖥️ As a result, the scripts that are provided here can be adapted for a single task or even multiple tasks 😄!
